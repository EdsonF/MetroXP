MetroUI.MVC.AJAX
=======



This an MVC 4 web application that shows how to use the Metro UI CSS 2.0.


To give the application a SPA feel, the pages are loaded via AJAX and it uses history.js to maintain state between page navigations.


The ultimate goal of this template is to demonstrate the amazing power of the Metro UI CSS set of styles to create cuting edge User Interface similar to Windows 8.
